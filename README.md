# 📚 Multilingual RAG System (Bangla + English) using DeepSeek AI

A simple, robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers **Bangla and English** queries using context retrieved from a Bangla PDF (HSC26 Bangla 1st Paper). Powered by DeepSeek via OpenRouter, FAISS for semantic chunk search, and MongoDB for storing chat history.

> 🎯 Ideal for building educational AI apps for students, educators, and researchers in Bangladesh.

## 🧠 Assessment Answers

### ❓ What method or library did you use to extract the text, and why? Did you face any formatting challenges with the PDF content?

We used **PyMuPDF** (`fitz`) to extract Bangla text from the PDF. It provides:
- Accurate text block recognition
- Unicode-friendly output (crucial for Bangla script)
- Faster and cleaner than `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer`

**Challenge:** Some line breaks caused sentence splits — resolved with preprocessing.

---

### ❓ What chunking strategy did you choose? Why do you think it works well for semantic retrieval?

We used **overlapping character-based chunking**:
- Each chunk is 1000 characters long
- 200 characters overlap to preserve context across boundaries

✅ Works well because:
- Keeps sentences mostly intact
- Compatible with FAISS
- Avoids truncation of meaningful content

---

### ❓ What embedding model did you use? Why did you choose it? How does it capture the meaning of the text?

We used `sentence-transformers` with a **multilingual model**:
- Supports both English and Bangla
- Captures sentence-level meaning
- Produces dense embeddings for retrieval
- Compatible with FAISS

---

### ❓ How are you comparing the query with your stored chunks? Why did you choose this similarity method and storage setup?

We use **cosine similarity** via FAISS:
- Fast L2-based vector matching (`IndexFlatL2`)
- Embedding vectors stored locally in `vector_db/`
- Matches query → top chunks → passed to LLM

✅ This is efficient and well-optimized for similarity search.

---

### ❓ How do you ensure that the question and the document chunks are compared meaningfully? What would happen if the query is vague or missing context?

We embed both the **question** and **chunks** using the same model.

✅ Meaningful matching ensured because:
- Chunk overlap keeps local context
- FAISS returns top-K nearest vectors

⚠️ If a query is vague:
- It may return irrelevant chunks
- LLM may hallucinate or generate incorrect guesses
- We recommend better chunking or query refinement to improve accuracy

---

### ❓ Do the results seem relevant? If not, what might improve them?

Yes, for direct textbook questions, results are highly accurate.

To improve:
- Use sentence-aware chunking instead of character
- Use cross-encoder re-ranking
- Fine-tune embeddings on textbook data

## 🧑‍💻 Installation Guide (Windows)

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB installed or MongoDB Atlas URI
- Internet connection

---

### 1. Clone or Create Project

```bash
mkdir multilingual-rag-system && cd multilingual-rag-system
mkdir models database data vector_db
python -m venv rag_env
rag_env\Scripts\activate
````

---

### 2. Add Your PDF

Place your Bangla PDF in `data/`:

```
data/HSC26-Bangla1st-Paper.pdf
```

---

### 3. Create `.env` file

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

If using Atlas:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/
```

---
